INSTALLATION AND ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE SETUP
-------------------------------------------

When cloning this repo for the first time, you will need to update your system's environment variables to
add the PSYQ related ones and also create the PSYQ.INI file in the \psyq\bin directory.

1) Run EnvVarsSetup.bat
2) Run PsyQSetup.bat

You should now be ready to go!
The currently supported IDE is VS2017, however you can also use any text editor to edit your sourcecode.


NOTE: You might need to run the batch files with administration priviledges.
