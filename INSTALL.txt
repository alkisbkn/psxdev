INSTALLATION AND ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE SETUP
-------------------------------------------

When cloning this repo for the first time, you will need to update your system's environment variables to
add the PSYQ related ones and also create the PSYQ.INI file in the \psyq\bin directory.

1) Run EnvVarsSetup.bat
2) Run PsyQSetup.bat

You should now be ready to go!
For ease of sourcecode navigation, there is a VS2017 project, but of course you can use any text editor.
