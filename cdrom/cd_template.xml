<!-- MKPSXISO example XML script -->

<!-- <iso_project>
	Starts an ISO image project to build. Multiple <iso_project> elements may be
	specified within the same xml script which is useful for multi-disc projects.

	<iso_project> elements must contain at least one <track> element.
	
	Attributes:
		image_name	- File name of the ISO image file to generate.
		cue_sheet	- File name of the cue sheet for the image file
					  (Optional, required if more than one track is specified, not needed
					  if you don't use CD audio in your project).
-->
<iso_project image_name="cdrom/PROJECTNAME_PLACEHOLDER.bin" cue_sheet="cdrom/PROJECTNAME_PLACEHOLDER.cue">

	<!-- <track>
		Specifies a track to the ISO project. This example element creates a data
		track for storing data files and CD-XA/STR streams.
	
		Only one data track is permitted and data tracks must only be specified as the
		first track in the ISO image and cannot	be specified past an audio track.
		
		Attributes:
			type		- Track type (either data or audio).
			source		- For audio tracks only, specifies the file name of a wav audio
						  file as source data for the audio track.
			
	-->
	<track type="data">
	
		<!-- <identifiers>
			Optional, Specifies the identifier strings for the data track.
				
			Attributes:
				system			- Optional, specifies the system identifier (default to PLAYSTATION).
				application		- Optional, specifies the application identifier (defaults to PLAYSTATION).
				volume			- Optional, specifies the volume identifier.
				volume_set		- Optional, specifies the volume set identifier.
				publisher		- Optional, specifies the publisher identifier.
				data_preparer	- Optional, specifies the data preparer identifier (defaults to a lengthy
								  description specifying that the image file was generated using MKPSXISO).

		<!-- <license>
			Optional, specifies the license file to use. The file format of the license file must be in
			raw 2336 byte sector format, like the ones included with the PlayStation Programmer's Tool
			SDK (also known as PsyQ SDK) in PS\CDGEN\LCNSFILE.
			
			License data is not included within the MKPSXISO program to avoid possible legal problems
			in the open source environment... Better be safe than sorry.
			
			Attributes:
				file	- Specifies the license file to inject into the ISO image.
		-->
		<license file="LICENSE_PLACEHOLDER"/>

		<!-- <directory_tree>
			Specifies and contains the directory structure for the data track.
			
			Attributes:
				srcdir	- Specifies the directory path to the source files if no source attribute is
						  specified to the <file> elements (optional, take note that it does not behave
						  like cd or chdir and must be a complete path, can be a relative or absolute path).
		-->
		<directory_tree>
		
			<!-- <file>
				Specifies a file in the directory tree.
					
				Attributes:
					name	- File name to use in the directory tree (can be used for renaming).
					type	- The file's type, options are 'data' for standard files, 'xa' for XA
							  audio and 'str' for MDEC video streams (optional, defaults to data).
					source	- File name of the source file (optional).
			-->
			<!-- Stores system.txt as system.cnf -->
			<file name="system.cnf"	type="data"	source="cdrom/system.txt"/>			
			<file name="main.exe"	type="data"	source="main.exe"/>
						
			<!-- <dir>
				Specifies a subdirectory to the directory structure. <file> and <dir> elements inside
				the element will be stored inside it.
				
				Attributes:
					name	- Specifies the name of the subdirectory.
					srcdir	- Specifies the directory path to the source files if no source attribute is
							  specified to the <file> elements (optional, take note that it does not behave
							  like cd or chdir and must be a complete path, can be a relative or absolute path).
						  
			-->			
FILES_PLACEHOLDER
			
			<!-- <dummy>
				Specifies an invisible dummy file to be generated into the file system. Use this to
				add dummy sectors, usually at the end of the file system portion of the image to avoid
				the possibility of 'drive runaway' which can damage a drive mechanism.
				
				The dummy file is completely invisible as it is not added into the directory records
				of the ISO image entirely which ensures a clean directory structure when the file system is
				viewed on a file browser.
				
				Attributes:
					sectors	- Size of dummy file in sector units (1024 = 2MB).
			-->
			<dummy sectors="1024"/>
