This directory contains two examples of (very simple) sub programs linked with
 startup.obj. It starts up the PSX subsystems as specified in the demo spec, 
recovers the the demo mode, timeout in seconds, and CD DA information, 
properly shuts down the PSX subsystems, and then returns control to the 
launcher.

You can try out this sample code using the included launcher and the .cti 
file in the launcher directory. 

Good luck!
