This directory contains launcher, a simple launch program based on the one for
the full demo disk. There is a makefile for making launch.exe, the source for 
launch, in case you need to make temporary changes (temporary, mind) and an 
example cti file showing how to lay out an example program on the emulator to 
be loaded by and run by launch. Incidentally, launch uses bs.lib, a specially 
built subset of the full libraries. bs.lib is copyright SCEE.

What does launch do ?

Basically, it boots the machine, displays  a crappy icon, and then loads and 
runs the executable at the location specified in source. Currently, this 
location is sector 24. You will likely need to modify this location to match
your situation.

If your code is all ok, and all is well, the dev system should printf to the 
host:

<Some stuff about the bs heap, data locations and so on>
<Followed by the stuff from PadInit()>
<and lastly:>

Launcher: Set loc for seek
Launcher: Program go.

At this point, launch has seeked to your program and is loading it. Immediately
after this, your program will be run. If something goes wrong, launch will 
timeout and reboot the machine. This will probably cause repeated reboots, but
you never know. Now your game should be running. 

The executable will be loaded according to the XF_HDR data at the start of the
.EXE, ie it should have correct info in it or all will be lost; the program
is loaded to the address specified in the t_addr field, and the bss is cleared.
