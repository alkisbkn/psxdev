*** CDBoot DEX CD Emulator READ.ME ***
**************************************


Versions 3.x and 6.x are identical except that version 6.x reports
information back to the PC so that the PC can show the current CD activity
on screen.  This is achieved with the use of the CDMON.COM TSR.

If you install version 3.x of the boot code then no information will be
passed back to the PC but you do not need to worry about the interrupt
at all.



Installation:
=============

Either use the 'Load boot program' option from CDDisk
Or enter  CDDISK -bCDBOOT32.BIN

To update CDBOOT on your SCSI drive:
------------------------------------
- Stop emulation: (necessary since emulator hogs the SCSI drive)
    RESETPS 1	(allow DEX target to be selected)
    RUN SelCD	(suspend emulation)
    Install new CDBOOT using CDDISK

- Restart emulation:
    RESETPS 1	(force emulator to load new CDBOOT code from SCSI drive)
    RUN SelEmu	(restart emulation)



To use 6.x:
-----------

Run the program  CDMON

This will install a TSR which will display information from the CD
emulator in the top right of a standard text screen.  This information
will continuously update as the emulation progresses.  It can be switched
on and off by holding down the *left* hand control and shift keys and
pressing C.

This display will only work if :

(1)  You install version 6.x of the boot code    and
(2)  You have the PC hardware interrupt configured on the CD emulator
     card and you have informed CDBIOS of the interrupt number.

If you install version 6.x of the boot code but do not have the interrupt
set up properly or use an old version of CDBIOS then the emulator will
fail to function correctly.

If the PC executes programs that disable interrupts for an extensive
amount of time then version 6.x of the CD emulator may not function
correctly.



NEW for v3.3:
-------------

CDNOSK33 - This version is identical to CDBOOT33 except no seek simulation is done.




Note for H2500 users:
---------------------
Don't use RESETPS v1.04.
This sends an 'OPEN DOOR' signal to the emulator giving the impression that
the emulator has crashed!
Use RESETPS v1.05+





Version history:
----------------

3.7/6.7  - TC: 02.Sep.97
- Fixed a problem that caused problems with a certain Sony CD demo:
    DTL-S2002 (LIB v4.0) :: PSX\SAMPLE\DS\TUTO7
- This fix may well cause the problem fixed in v3.2 to show up again.
  If anyone suspects this is happening email me (tom@snsys.com) & use
  v3.6 instead.


3.6/6.6  - TC: 06.Jun.97
- CDBOOT35 + CDEMUPRM didn't work correctly if CDBIOS was installed without
  interrupts.


3.5/6.5  - TC: 21.Apr.97
- Use in conjunction with CDEMUPRM.EXE to adjust error & seek parameters.


3.4/6.4  - TC: 24.Jan.97
- Continuously trying to Play DA until successful (in a tight loop)
  would fail, since the simulated seek count would be reset each time.
  The upshot of this is that \psx\sample\cd\tuto\tuto3 now works!


3.3/6.3  - TC: 02.Dec.96
- Zero seek version.
- Some bug fixes.


3.2/6.2  - TC: 30.May.96
- Certain combinations of DEX board & Emulator card occasionally caused
  infinite seeking symptoms.
  This release has modified various time critical sections of code to be
  more tolerant to hardware timing thresholds.


3.1/6.1	 - TC: 11.Apr.96
- CD-DA now works after loading of CD-ROM data (why was this never reported?)
- More robust CD image swapping.


3.0/6.0  - TC: 24.Jan.96
- Door open simulation (use MultiCD).
- Ability to change to another CD image (use MultiCD).


1.8/2.8  - TC
- This version attempts to model the lens seeks correctly, and as with
  1.7 (& 2.7) longer arm seeks are also simulated better.
  It gives much better seeking accuracy that the older releases 1.5 and
  1.6.

1.7/2.7  - TC
1.6/2.6  - MD
1.5/2.5  - MD
1.0..1.4 - MD
