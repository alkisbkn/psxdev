STRIPISO Readme & Examples
==========================

STRIPISO can be used as a tool to convert BUILDCD image-files
to a standard ISO binary file, which can then be used directly
with CD burning/cutting software.

The example uses Golden Hawk Technology's DAO (Disk At Once)
cutting software.



STRIPISO command line help:
---------------------------

STRIPISO.EXE v1.05  Copyright 1998 S.N.Systems Ltd.
Purpose: Converts a BUILDCD image-file to a standard ISO binary
Usage  : D:\WATCOM\STRIPISO\STRIPISO.EXE [s] [nnnn] <in file> <out file>
  s    - Include system area (first 16 sectors)
  nnnn - Sector size: 2352(RAW), 2336(XA), 2048(MODE1) Default=2336

*** NB. Create the image-file using BUILDCD switch: -i



STRIPISO example using DAO:
---------------------------

* Convert Sony's LicenseX.DAT file with LCONVERT
  (BuildCD only accepts SystemArea files in 2048 byte/sector format
   but will be write them correctly whether your ROM track is Mode1 or XA.)


* Create your BuildCD CTI file with only the first ROM track defined.
  Remember to set SystemArea to your converted License file.
  This ROM track will either be of the type:
  - Mode1      = 2048 bytes/CD sector
  - Mode2 (XA) = 2336 bytes/CD sector


* Generate the image-file using BUILDCD 2.43 or greater, eg:
  BUILDCD -iTRACK1.IMG TRACK1.CTI

  NB1. Contrary to previous documentation, it is now recommended that you
       ENABLE EDC/ECC generation. This means DO NOT specify the -c switch
       when creating the image-file.

       The reason for this, is that DAO sets up some CDR's in a mode
       that disables generation of EDC/ECC. So the sector data must contain
       this pre-generated data before transmission to the CDR.

       If you are using 2048 byte sectors, then DAO is forced to putting
       the CDR into EDC/ECC generation mode.

  NB2. Use BuildCD 2.43 or greater. Older versions contained a bug whereby
       ECC codes were incorrectly generated for XA sectors.


* Convert to ISO image, eg:
  STRIPISO s 2336 TRACK1.IMG TRK1_XA.ISO

  NB1. The above will convert to a Mode2 (XA) ISO file and includes the
       system area.

  NB2. Some CDR's don't support 2336 bytes/sector cutting.
       If this is the case, then use 2352 bytes/sector.

  NB3. For PlayStation, only use 2048 bytes/sector if your ROM track
       doesn't contain any streams.


* Cut your gold CD using DAO, eg:
  DAO CD.CUE CD.LOG /ID=0:0:0 /SPEED=2


An example DAO cue sheet file:

FILE D:\TRK1_XA.ISO BINARY
  TRACK 01 MODE2/2336
    INDEX 01 00:00:00
  POSTGAP 00:02:00

FILE D:\TRK2_DA.DA BINARY
  TRACK 02 AUDIO
    PREGAP 00:02:00
    INDEX 01 00:00:00

FILE D:\TRK3_DA.DA BINARY
  TRACK 03 AUDIO
    PREGAP 00:02:00
    INDEX 01 00:00:00
