CD Emulator tools History
=========================

20 Aug 98:
----------
BUILDCD 2.43
BCDFLAT 2.43

- Fixed bug in ECC generation for XA sectors. This never appeared to be a problem
  for CD emulation, but when used in conjunction with STRIPISO to cut CD's, if
  your CDR didn't auto-generate the ECC values, then the CD would be unreadable.


6 July 98:
----------
UPDATECD 1.21

- Fixed bug I introduced in 1.20 concerning updating of MAP file.


3 June 98, New releases:
------------------------
CDDISK 1.19
UPDATECD 1.20
BUILDCD 2.42
BCDFLAT 2.42


- All 4 have been rebuilt to fix the problem with the Quantum Fireball SE.
  Previous versions would fail with the following error:

  C:\WINDOWS>CDDISK -n 0
  Error in opening SCSI device 0, Error 0x06F0
  CDbios error string 'Unknown error code (F0)'

---

UPDATECD:
- Fixed: Map file/UpdateCD date seperator discrepency

---		        

BCDFLAT:
- Fixed: Source/Output files that were not on current drive, EG:
  > C:
  > BCDFLAT CD.CTI -mD:CD.MAP

  (This also fixes source files within the script that reference other drives.)

---

BUILDCD & BCDFLAT:
- XA interleaved files (XASOURCE) now show correct byte size in their
  file record, this is:
      Number of CD Sectors * 2048

- XA interleaving now sets Subheader File#=1 & Channel#'s start from 0.
  This complies with the CDROM XA standard and also MOVPACK.
  This may cause problems, since previous versions wouldn't accept
  Channel#0, so you may have to update your script(CTI) to the correct
  channel numbering scheme (valid channels are 0 to 31).

- XA interleaved audio sectors now setup the Subheader's Coding Information
  bytes correctly for ADPCM_B & ADPCM_C.
