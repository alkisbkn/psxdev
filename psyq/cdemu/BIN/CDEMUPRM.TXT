Document to explain the usage of CDEMUPRM.EXE for the CD Emulator
=================================================================

This utility allows you to select normal or zero seek timings; and
also control errors within CD streams.


Both settings are unaffected by RESETPS (which causes the CD emulator's
micro controller to reload CDBOOT from the SCSI HD).



Requirements:
-------------
Use at least CDBOOT35/CDBOOT65.




Seek Control
------------

To select zero seek times:
CDEMUPRM s 0


To reset the seek time to the default algorithm parameters:
CDEMUPRM s 1





Error Control
-------------

General usage:
CDEMUPRM e [prm1,,prmN]


The error insertion algorithm is activated by the DEX issuing a
CdlReadS command to the CD sub-system.
This command is used to playback streams - if an error occurs, then
the DEX will receive an interrupt, but the sub-system won't retry to
read the sector.


Errors can be inserted at a fixed frequency or randomly via seed &
threshold parameters. A RESETPS will reset the internal parameters
to what you originally specified, so that error patterns can be
repeated on you CD sector stream.


The error algorithm is done before a CD sector is signalled ready for
the DEX to receive it. This means that error patterns can be reproduced,
since during seeks (which vary for same seeks!) the Random() fn isn't
called.


    Rnd = Random()

    err_Count--
    if(err_Count==0)
    {
	err_Count=err_Period	// Reset the Count

	if(Threshold>=Rnd)
	    Signal to DEX that this sector contains an error.
    }


CDEmuPrm ERROR parameters:    Default values:
  (UInt32)PERIOD	      0000 0000
  (UInt16)THRESHOLD	      0000
  (UInt47)SEED		      7FFF FFFF FFF8

PERIOD is in CD sectors.
THRESHOLD is a 16 bit unsigned WORD.
SEED is a 47 bit WORD.


--- To obtain a fixed frequency:
Specify a PERIOD only.

Eg: CDEMUPRM e 100
This will setup the system to produce errors every 256 sectors.

IMPORTANT: Use a PERIOD > 1.


--- To obtain a random error pattern:
Specify a PERIOD, THRESHOLD & an optional SEED.

Eg: CDEMUPRM e 10 1000
This will setup the system to produce an error every 16 sectors, but only
if the current random value is >= 0x1000.


Some values that could be useful:
PERIOD	THRESHOLD	# of sectors read after 0x80 errors:
0x10	0xF000		0x4000
0x10	0x8000		0x0F00
0x10	0x1000		0x0880


--- To stop errors occurring:
CDEMUPRM e
This will set all parameters to their defaults.




** Important Notes
The way the parameters are modified is fundamentally:
- Open door
- Modify parameters
- Close door

So parameters can't be modified on the fly during streaming playback.
You should set the parameters up at the start of your emulation session
and only adjust them at suitable times; IE after a RESETPS 1.
