CONTENTS OVERVIEW:   
This zip file contains binaries, boot files, documentation, 
and samples for the CD Emulator.  It contains the same binaries and files 
as Release 1.13.1, but "\sample\basic\cd.c" has been corrected.

It was compiled from the SN CD Emulator diskette, files from 
the SN FTP site, and from resources at 
SCEA.   "Readme.doc" also has the latest hard drives that are
compatible with the CD Emulator.  You should visit the SN System's
Web Site at www.snsys.com for access to their FTP site.

follow the instructions in README.DOC.  In addition, the CD Emulator
User's Guide is distributed in the "doc" directory of this distribution
and should also have come with your CD Emulator.

	BOOT FILES
	============	
	CBOOT36.bin	3.6		Emulator Boot code.
	CDNOSK3x.bin	DELETED 	For old timers: The reason there is 
					no CDNOSK3x.BIN any more is that, with 
					the advent of version CDBOOT3.6, the seek 
					timings are now programmable using the 
					utility called CDEMUPRM.
 	cdboot66.bin	6.6		Emulator Boot code, identical to version 
					36.bin, except that version 6.6 reports 
					information back to the PC so that the PC 
					can show the current CD activity on screen.  
					This is achieved with the use of the 
					CDMON.COM TSR.
