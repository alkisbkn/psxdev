NOTES:

Known Bugs and Cautions
----------------------------------------------------------------------

<Exclusion of Memory Card GUI Module>
- McGUI, the module which supports the Memory Card access in the user 
interface level is not included in this release.  Due to technical problems 
associated with converting this file for use with Codewarrior.  For more 
information contact Metrowerks directly.


<Limitations on libhmd>
- The environment map is provided as a Beta version, because the 
format may change in future releases without keeping compatibility.  
The Beta-version primitives are not officially supported by SCE at 
this point.  If you want to use them for creating titles, please do 
so on your own responsibility.

<Addition of libmcx>
- Libmcx, the library to control the PDA, was added.


<Deletion of libsn.a>
- Libsn.a was deleted, because it was judged unnecessary.

<Known Bugs>
- In the Extended Sound Library (libsnd), the phonation of noise 
currently does not work properly. Use the Basic Sound Library 
(libspu) to use noises. This problem will be fixed in the next 
release.

- When channel starts/stops are repeatedly executed during SPU streaming
execution, the SPU streaming might go into a loop. This problem will be 
fixed in the next release.
