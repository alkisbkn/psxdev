Known Bugs and Cautions
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
         -libpad.lib(controller library) has been added to support the 
          Analog Controller(DUAL SHOCK). libpad.lib not only supports
          the Analog Controller(DUAL SHOCK), but also supports all
          other controllers including GUNCON and Multi tap. In order to 
          use the functions of the Analog Controller(DUAL SHOCK) it is 
          necessary to have libpad.lib. Therefore, for future controller 
          control we recommend libpad.lib. Please note that libpad.lib 
          cannot be used together with the current libgun.lib, 
          libtap.lib and libpad.lib.
          Furthermore, in libapi.lib, the SendPad() function has been 
          deleted. Therefore, in order to use the vibration feature of 
          the Analog Controller(SCPH-1180), libpad.lib will be needed.
          Please note that it is necessary to use the latest version for 
          libapi.lib, libapi.h, libpad.lib and libpad.h.  
          
          Please refer to Runtime Library Overview and Reference manuals
          for details.

        - Regarding polygon non-active/active sub-division, the HMD 
          primitive driver function for libgs has restrictions. 
          For the (maximum)number of sub-divisions, do not set a number
          which is not defined in GsUNIT_DIV1 - 5 of libgs.h or 
          DIV2x2 - DIV32x32 of hmd.def.
          Please especially note that the number "0" will not work.
         

        - bsearch function in the C Standard Library(libc/c2) does not
          work correctly.  This malfunction is planned to be fixed in
          the next release.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
##Library Bug Fix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
         -When standard input/output functions such as firstfile function,
          open, read are executed on different devices, for some orders 
          and combinations of executions, standard input/output functions 
          such as open and read did not work properly. This malfunction
          has been corrected.
                  
         -When executing free3() after changing the size of an area 
          allocated in malloc3() using realloc3(), the area was not 
          completely freed. This malfunction has been corrected.
          
Functions Deleted
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
         -Following the new addition of libpad.lib, SendPad()
          has been deleted. 



C Standard Library(libc/c2)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
##Library Bug Fix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
         -When memset() was used, there was a warning while compiling the 
          software. This malfunction has been corrected by commenting out
          the memset() argument within memory.h.



Link Cable Library(libcomb)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
##Functions Added and Header File Modified
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
         -For all features currently implemented using the _comb_control
