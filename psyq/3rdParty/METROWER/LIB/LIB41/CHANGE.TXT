----------------------------------------------------------------------

Known Bugs and Cautions
----------------------------------------------------------------------
-The name, "Psy-Q", in the development tool hardware and software
has been changed to "SDevTC" from this release.  The formal name
is "Software Development Tool Chain".  Although the
contents are the same as those of the former version, note that
names of directory or environment variable have been changed to
new ones in Runtime Library Version 4.1 (e.g. name, "PSYQ", has
been changed to "PSSN").
For details please refer to PSSN\README.1ST.

-When option /wl is specified in psylink, the following warning
 message is displayed: 

           Redefinition of symbol '__fixunsdfsi' has been ignored
           Redefinition of symbol '__fixunssfsi' has been ignored

 This occurs because function with the name above exists both in
 libsn and libmath.
 When floating-point operation is not used, it does not affect
 execution files.  Even in the case when floating-point operation
 is used, any malfunction caused by using it has not be found so
 far.  We are planning to solve this warning problem by next 
 release. 


- In libds, when the simple callback is set so that cover open/close 
  recovery will be done in system, if player intentionally 
  replaces disc with other one, system can not recognize it and
  will read improper data, which may hinder continuing the game
  play.

   Note: The specification above is acceptable because the present
         quality standard, TRC specifies that it is an optional 
	   to deal with the case in which player intentionally
          opens the cover or changes disc when application does not ask
          player to. 

-libapi.h has been newly created, and prototype statements in 
  kernel.h have been integrated into libapi.h.  (kernel.h is now
  dedicatedly used for event control services.)

  Note that libapi.h (not kernel.h) should be included when 
  libapi.lib is used. 


DMPSX
----------------------------------------------------------------------
-inline_c.h macro

		gte_ldsvrtrow0()

The description above has been modified.  The reference for 
Arguments, "r( r1 )", has been deleted because it was 
unnecessary. 


SDevTC (Former Psy-Q) Tool
----------------------------------------------------------------------
DEXBIOS 1.26
---------------
  -Using DTL-H2700 on the former version DEXBIOS caused malfunction
   that "printf() works very slow though IRQ is set".   This 
   malfunction has been fixed in this release.  In the same way of
   H2000, using both IRQ interrupt and MESS1 together can make high
   speed output possible. 

SDevTC resetps.exe Version-Up
--------------------------------
-The bug that printf of libc2 in DTL-H2500 and DTL-H2700
 does not work correctly has been fixed.
 The new version of resetps.exe is version 1.08.

SDevTC H2700 Flash Utility Added
------------------------------------
-Flash Utility for DTL-H2700 has been added.
 The flash utility corresponds to resetps 1.08.

Other Changes
---------------
-Please refer to PSSN\README_J.TXT.
  

Kernel Library (libapi)
------------------------------------------------------------
Header File Modified
------------------------
- In order to call a function of libapi.lib, libapi.h should be 
  included in stead of kernel.h in source code.  Thus, please 
  change the existing source code as to include libapi.h 
  instead of kernel.h. 

-Since bu_init is also defined in libapi.h, please delete
 description of the definition in libapi.h.

Library Bug Fix
-----------------
-The malfunction that the return values of InitPAD and StartPAD were 
  not returned has been fixed.
	  
	-The malfunction that the values of "event" and "tcb" were set reverse 
         in Setconf() has been fixed.


Memory Card Library (libcard)
------------------------------------------------------------
Library Bug Fix
------------------
-The malfunction that the memory card insert/remove status change
  cannot be detected when a mouse and a memory card is inserted 
  into port-2 and slot-2 respectively because IOE event is 
  incorrectly returned instead of the correct NEW_CARD event 
  with the event by _card_info() when the memory card is 
  removed/inserted, has been fixed. 


CD-ROM Library/Streaming Library (libcd)
---------------------------------------------
Library Bug Fix
------------------------------
 -The malfunction that issuing CdPlay( 3, 0, 0 ) while having DA  
  play by CdPlay() makes music restart from the first track  
  has been fixed. 

-The malfunction that StFunc1 and StFunc2, variables in libcd, 
 had multiple definitions has been fixed.

-In libcd of release 4.0, the warning, "Warning : Multiple 
 declarations ...", occurred when libcd was linked after 
 specifying /vm option in ccpsx.  The cause of this malfunction 
 was that some variables used in libcd had multiple definitions. 
 This malfunction has been fixed in this release 4.1.
	 

Extended CD-ROM Library (libds)
---------------------------------------------
Function Added
------------------------------
-The function, DsReadySystemMode(), that specifies whether or not
 to retry when the disc cover is opened by the simple callback has 
 been added. 

Please refer to the function reference for details.

Header File Modified
------------------------------
-Change has been made so that libds.h conforms to C++.


Library Bug Fix
------------------------------
-The malfunction that in DsStartReadySystem() value does not 
 return when process succeeds has been fixed.  In relation to 
 this fix, change has been made, so that in DsRead() and DsPlay()
 process will not be done (function execution will fail) when
 the simple callback is in operation when function is being called.
 This change will not affect the standard usage.
 
-Prototype statement for DsGetToc() has been added.

-The malfunction that the system does not respond even when
 the disc cover is opened after it becomes DslNoCD when the cover
 is closed without setting a disc, has been fixed. 

-The malfunction that callback is not called when the cover of
 disc is opened by the simple callback has been fixed.

-Measure has been taken to the malfunction that DiskError
 interrupt is not reported on rare occasion when read command
 fails.  When DslStatRead is not set 20 seconds 
 after command execution, callback routine set in DsSyncCallback()
 and DsReadyCallback() are called as an error process.
 Please specify recovery routine that reissues the command to
 to either of the two: (Note that specifying 
 recovery in both callbacks makes the command to be executed
 twice).  Ready callback will be invoked first.

       DsRead()
       DsPlay()

Since high level functions such as those above or the simple
callbacks use function for retrying, application does not need 
to take care of the recovery process. 

-The improper reaction taken when the disc cover is opened 
 during disc is being recognized by the system just after the
 cover was opened/closed with the simple callback has been fixed.

-The malfunction in recovery process caused when the cover is 
  opened/closed with the simple callback has been fixed and the contents
  has been made clear.  In release 4.0, command was reissued and 
  process continued even after the cover was opened/closed during 
  the simple callback was in operation and this has been found out to be
  a side effect of the malfunction in the library.  Thus, the
  improper reaction taken after the cover is opened/closed during
  the simple callback is in operation has been fixed.
  For the detail descriptions on the fix please refer to OVERVIEW
  document.

Header File Modified
------------------------------
-libsnd.h has been changed since function and structure have been added.

Library Bug Fix
------------------------------
-The malfunction that the reverberations remain even after SEQ 
  has been stopped when reverb is specified for SEQ playback,
  has been fixed.  

-The malfunction that the volume did not smoothly change on 
 some settings or the sound is cut off while the volume change
 on some music in SsSetSeq(Sep)Crescendo(Decrescendo), has been 
 fixed.
 Note that we recommend you to set "v_time" given for these function,
 to be an integral multiple of "vol". 

-In "Ut" functions, inconsistency between the volume value of 
 effect sound set and the obtained volume value has been resolved.

-The malfunction that noise was emitted at unexpected time if 
 noise source was used with SEQ in libsnd of release 4.0 has been
 fixed.  It is also possible to use the previously suggested method
 of directly calling the libspu/libsnd function with the Programmer 
 Tool(PC) or sampling the noise sound itself and using it as an
 ordinary sound wave form.
