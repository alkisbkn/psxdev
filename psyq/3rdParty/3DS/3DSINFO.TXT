Dear Sirs,

We have released 3 tools for 3D Studio (3ds2rsd, RSD plug-in, and TOD plug-in).
The latest "TOD plug-in" (version 2.1 and later) supports RSD files export.
So, it can be used as saving object data as well as saving animation data.
Please use "TOD plug-in" instead of 3ds2rsd or RSD plug-in.

We will not support 3ds2rsd nor "RSD plug-in" hereafter.

Thank you.
