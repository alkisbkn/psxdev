SO               compressed tar file with the actual translator and source


Notes:
------

1) The RSD files as generated by this version of the translator are the same as
   for previous versions.

Running the Sony utility "rsdlink" on the RSD files will not generate the same
TMD file that the translator outputs directly.

The output paths have been considered separate, and no attempt was made to 
ensure that they would match.  This is being looked into for a future version
of the translator.


2) The TOD file output for the TRS components will work with the Sony supplied
   TOD demo viewer, change from the release notes in the documentation.




The file SO is a compressed tar file that the "InstallGame" script will 
decompress and install into the Alias tree.

Assuming that the SO file is copied into the users HOME directory, and that
Alias has been installed normally such that there is a symbolic link from
/usr/aw/alias, would use the following command to install the files.


1) become root

su
(enter password if needed)


2) ensure that ALIAS_LOCATION is setup

setenv ALIAS_LOCATION /usr/aw/alias


3) run the "InstallGame" script

/usr/aw/alias/ODS/Games/bin/InstallGame -e -f $HOME -s SO


The SO file should then be uncompressed and untar'd into the default
Alias location tree for use with the mgame plugin.

See the Alias V8.2 Addendum book (page 128) for additional installation notes.
