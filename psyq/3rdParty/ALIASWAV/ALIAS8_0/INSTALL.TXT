the PSX translator, source code, and demo PC viewer program.

The major changes from the version of 7.5.1 are:

1) adding controls for STP bit in TIM files
2) adding control for freezing texture in VRAM, so its not moved
3) RSD .mat file has option for what UV coordinates to use in VRAM space

4) the "autoplace" button is currently disabled

There is a html file PSX_doc.html which describes the Installation, use, 
and current known limitations.


Quick Version to Install:
-------------------------

Once the files are untar'd there will be the following files:

Install.README      this file
SO                  compressed tar file of the Translator
doc/                directory containing the html version of the documentation
                             

Assuming that the downloaded file is placed into the user's HOME directory

md SonyBBS
cd SonyBBS
tar xvf ~/AliasPSX.tar

su -l root

setenv ALIAS_LOCATION /usr/aw/alias

$ALIAS_LOCATION/ODS/Games/bin/InstallGame -e -f ~/SonyBBS -s SO

exit



If would need to install into a local directory can add in the "-t directory"
command line option to write to a directory tree.  Make sure that it exists
before running the InstallGame script else will return error message of not
being able to write to the given directory.  The given directory names should 
be fully qualified names (no relative paths please).
