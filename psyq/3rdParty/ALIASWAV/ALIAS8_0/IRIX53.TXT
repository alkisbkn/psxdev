    -------------------------------------------------------------

             Alias 8.0 and later are not supported on Irix 5.3.  

           When running Alias 8.0 and the PlayStation translator 
         on an Irix 5.3 machine, may cause a Fatal Error in Alias.

                  This has been fixed in Alias 8.1.



In the mean time, the included DSO library file libDtUt.so can be used to 
replace the current version in $ALIAS_LOCATION/ODS/Games/lib.

1) Change to super user

su


2) Save the original file to a new name

cp $ALIAS_LOCATION/ODS/Games/lib/libDtUt.so $ALIAS_LOCATION/ODS/Games/lib/libDtUt.so=


3) Copy over the new version of the library

cp libDtUt.so $ALIAS_LOCATION/ODS/Games/lib
