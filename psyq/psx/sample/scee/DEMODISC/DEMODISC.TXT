CONTENTS OVERVIEW:

This file contains the source code hook for use in the Demo Sampler 
CD used by the European developers. It was updated to work
with Library 4.0, although the bootstrap code should work
with any version of libcd. Please contact SCEE's developer
support (dev_support@interactive.sony.com) 
for more information. Developers who need 
to create code for the North American Demo Sampler CD
should continue to use the code in \PSX\SAMPLE\SCEA\SAMPLER,
which is a derivative of SCEE's work and is 
maintained by LifeLike.

INSTRUCTIONS:
Use PkUnzip or WinZip to extract the contents of this file to
a suitable directory. Read the "readme.txt" that appears in the 
root directory.  Each of the other directories also has
a "readme.txt" that you should read.

===================
CONTENTS IN DETAIL:

This code was written by SCEE's Allan J Murphy, Paul Holman, Vince Diesi, 
Richard Milner, and David Virapen, among others.
It contains the following directories.

bs:             Bootstrap program source, and a readme. 
                This boots the machine, and will load and run your program 
                under the conditions it will have on the demo disk.

docs:		Contains an MS Word and Text version of the document
		describing how the playable game segments should be
		constructed.

none2:          This directory contains a reworking of the SCEI none2.obj,
                which is a replacement for libsn.lib, allowing your program
                to return to the calling program (ie bs.exe) properly.
                This version includes the libsn variables __heapbase et al.

setsp:          This directory contains 2 PC utilities for working with
                PlayStation .EXE files - dumpexe, which dumps the information
                from the XF_HDR info at the start of an EXE file, and setsp,
                which can be used to set the correct stack pointer in a
                PlayStation .EXE file (as the cpe2x converter does not, and
                the demo disk needs to know where the stack goes).

example:        This directory has an example program which runs under bs.exe,
                and shows how to retrieve arguments from the parent, and set
                up and close down the various subsystems without breaking
                anything.
