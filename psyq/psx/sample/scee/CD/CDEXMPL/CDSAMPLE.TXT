CONTENTS IN DETAIL

Author: Mike Kavallierou

Example Code showing various different CD loading techniques.

NOTES		This is the first version of this sample code so there's
		just bound to be the odd error. If you find any
		problems / see anything stupid or alternatively wish to
		either comment on the code or request other samples you
		feel are lacking from the current set of sample code (as
		if) mail me at work  - Mike_Kavallierou@playstation.sony.com

		You will need to change the various filenames for your
		own in all the examples as I have not included any of
		the files I reference in any of the loading demos except
		for example 6 where both quotes.dat and test.txt are
		included

		Create zip file with the following command:
			pkzip -p -r cd.zip *.*

Directory Structure
*******************

CompTool - Compression Tools and source code used for these examples
 
Example1 - Normal data file loading, however some extra functions.
		Functions to cache file positions and create a
		pos.h file for use instead of CdSearchFile in the final
		build.
		Tracker function to provide a file on PC containing the
		order of files accessed to enable restructuring of the
		CD file layout to an optimal one.

Example2 - Modified Example1 showing compressed data file loading,
		uses the RSB compression after file has been loaded
		in.

Example3 - Modified Example1 showing compressed data file loading,
		uses the RS compression after file has been loaded
		in.

Example4 - Modified Example1 showing compressed data file loading,
		uses the RSB compression during file loading. This
		code is unfinished and therefore not tidied up

Example5 - Modified Example1 showing normal loading, the cd.h,cd.c files
		have been replaced with a new set of functions that
		use a callback system to load the data making it
		easier to hook in a loading animated graphic.

Example6 - Code for loading data on a per sector basis, data can be read
		into a 2k buffer which is filled with new data each
		time more data is required or alternatively a number
		of sectors can be read into a buffer in one go
test	- Test file images containing .TIM's and the compressed versions
		of the files used in the tests for the example code
