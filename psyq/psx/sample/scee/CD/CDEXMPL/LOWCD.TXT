CONTENTS IN DETAIL 
(written by Mike Kavallierou):

Example code showing CD access to obtain interesting information about CD's

NOTES		You will need to change the various filenames for your
		own in all the examples as I have not included any of
		the files I reference in any of the CD examples

Directory Structure
*******************

Example1 - New CdSearchFile which removes the limitations of the current
		library CdSearchFile. You can now have as many files
		as you want in a directory. Note that the various ISO-9660 limitations
		still apply, e.g. maximum 8 levels of directory depth etc..

Example2 - Modified example1, includes:
		CheckISO() function which checks that the CD is an
			ISO image

		displayPVD() function that displays some interesting information
		about the CD's PVD which contains details such as publisher / volume
		information

		GetRootDirDetails() obtains root directory info to
			allow the directory structure to be output

		PrintDirDetails() outputs CD directory structure
			including file sizes and positions

		Plus other utility functions to allow the main ones
		to operate
		
Example3 - Modified example2, includes:
		GetNumDirEntries() function that returns the number of files
			within a specified directory

		GetDirDetails() function that fills a structure with
			file information from a specified directory
		
Example4 - Modified example2, includes:
		CheckDisk() function which checks that the CD file
			layout is compliant with the library
			CdSearchFile() function

Example5 - CD browser program using the techniques used in the previous
			examples. This program can be used to browse
			CD's and preview standard .TIM and .STR files from any
			CD.
			Other functions such as a sound player could be
			added. The program also can be used to display
			the file details such as size and position on
			the CD. Also the example shows how to swap
			disks on the PlayStation
