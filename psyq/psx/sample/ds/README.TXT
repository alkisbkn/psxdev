About the samples:
--------------------------

Refer to the HTML document "REAMDE.HTM" at the root
of the Programmer Tools CD-ROM to find information
on how to run the samples and to get a brief description
of each sample.  

If you do not have an HTML browser, you should get one,
since the developer support for SCEA and SCEE is Web-based.
Your browser should be HTML 3.0 compliant (able to 
process tables).  Alternatively, refer to the document 
\doc\allsamp.pdf using an Adobe Acrobat Reader included
in the "Acrobat" directory of this CD..

This information is also duplicated (and is searchable) 
on the Technical Reference CD.
