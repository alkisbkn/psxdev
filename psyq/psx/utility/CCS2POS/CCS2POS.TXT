This is a utility that takes a .CCS file (as saved from CD-Gen 
software) as input, and outputs a header file, with all the files 
defined as macros and their values having their absolute sector
address on the CD.

This method of locating files on the CD is intended to be a faster
alternative for CdSearchFile().  Using a header file, with hard-coded 
locations reduces the seek times because only one seek is required.  
See the Developer Conference '96 slides on the CD Overview : Part One 
talk for more details.

It is advisable to have your main executable file as the last file in 
track one.  This allows the size of this executable to vary, without 
changing any of the locations of the preceding files.

In this utility, the filenames are used without the path.  Therefore, 
all files will need to have a unique filename.  Later versions of this 
utility may include full paths - but don't count on it.  The full stop
preceding the extension cannot be used in a macro definition and 
therefore are replaced with an underscore.  For example, the 
location for the file LEV1_MOD.DAT;1 will be referenced by the macro 
LEV1_MOD_DAT.   As you may have noticed, the ";1" has also been 
ommitted from the macro.

Once the header file has been created, recompile the code and build 
the emulator image or burn the CD and away you go!!!.
