Known Bugs and Cautions
---------------------------------------------------------------------
<Addition of HMD Library libhmd> 
- HMD-related functions, which were included in LIBGS and LIBGTE in 
PlayStation library release 4.2 or earlier, were separated as LIBHMD.  
Due to this change, HMD-related functions and declarations were 
removed from LIBGS and LIBGTE libraries and header files.  Please use 
the HMD library (LIBHMD) together with libhmd.h.

The environment map is provided as a Beta version, because the format 
may change in future releases without keeping compatibility.  The 
Beta-version primitives are not officially supported by SCE at this 
point.  If you want to use them for creating titles, please do so on 
your own responsibility.

<Addition of printver>
- Pkver, used to check the version, was found not to show the version 
of many files.  Printver is introduced in this release.

<Deletion of pkver>
- Consequently, pkver was deleted.

<Known Bugs>
- When PadInitMtap() is used for initializing, the mouse may not be 
recognized on rare occasions.  Remove the mouse once and insert it 
again for it to be recognized.

- In the Extended Sound Library (libsnd), the phonation of noise 
currently does not work properly.  Use the Basic Sound Library 
(libspu) to use noises.  This problem will be fixed in the next 
release.

- When the process for the OT is suspended by BreakDraw(), and 
the process is resumed after inserting another OT by ContinueDraw(),
the last packet of the inserting OT does not be executed.
To avoid this problem, please use NULL packet (size 0 packet) for the
last of the inserting OT. This problem will be fixed in the next 
release.

SDevTC Tools
---------------------------------------------------------------------
<DOS Environment Variable Changes>
- Starting from CCPSX version 3.06.0015, DOS environment variables are

DMPSX
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- Changed to a 32-bit program.

- Long file names are supported.


Kernel Library (libapi)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
<Header File Modification>
- A _card_format() prototype statement was added to libapi.h.

<Library Bug Fix>
- When a NULL address was passed to free3(), the operation became 
unstable.  This problem has been fixed.

- bsearch() did not work properly.  This problem has been fixed.


CD-ROM Library (libcd)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
<Header File Modification>
- Due to multiple-defined prototype statements, a warning messsage was 
returned when libds.h was included before libcd.h.  This problem has 
been fixed.

<Library Bug Fixes>
- When CdRead() was used, "sync callback" was called by the "pause" 
primitive issued after read was completed. This problem has been fixed 
so that this callback is not called at this timing.

- When function CdPlay() or DsPlay() was used, the specified track was 
not played, and was skipped.  This problem has been fixed.

- When the Disc Cover was opened during the execution of CdDiskReady(),
CdlStatShellOpen was not returned. This problem has been fixed.


Extended CD-ROM Library (libds)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
<Library Bug Fixes>
- When DsRead() was used, "sync callback" was called by the "pause" 
primitive issued after read was completed. This problem has been fixed 
so that this callback is not called at this timing.

- DsGetDiskType() did not return DslStatShellOpen when the Disc Cover 
was open.  This problem has been fixed.

- When CdPlay() or DsPlay() was used, the specified track was not 
played, and was skipped.  This problem has been fixed.

- When packests issued by DsRead() overflew from the queue, subsequent 
DsRead() always failed.  This problem has been fixed.

- DsCommand() and DsPacket() occasionally returned an error even if 
a command had been registered.  This problem has been fixed.

- When DslGetlocL and DslGetlocP primitive commands were used during 10,
30 and 50-minute sector reads, a DslDiskError occurred.  This problem 
has been fixed.

- When specific functions such as DsRead() and DsSearchFile() were 
called frequently, data became unable to be read.  This problem has 
been fixed.

- When DsPlay() was used, only the first track was played even if 
multiple tracks were specified.  This problem has been fixed.


ETC Library (libetc)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
<Library Bug Fix>

- When KanjiFntPrint() was used, if 256 or more characters were 
registered to one stream, other part of the memory area was 
occasionally destroyed.  This problem has been fixed.

- When KanjiFntPrint() was used, when an incorrect code that is not 
included in kanji code was registered, subsequent KanjiFntFlush() 
became unable to display characters.  This problem has been fixed.

<Header File Modification>
- The prototype statements for the following functions declared in 
libgs.h were corrected.

		GsA4divNTF3()   -> GsA4divTNF3()
		GsA4divNTF4()   -> GsA4divTNF4()
		GsA4divNTF4M()  -> GsA4divTNF4M()
		GsA4divTG3LGG() -> GsA4divTG3LFG()
		GsA4divNTG3()   -> GsA4divTNG3()


Basic Geometry Library (libgte)

Gun Library (libgun)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
<Header File Modification>
- The prototype statement for StartGUN() was corrected (from void to 
long.)


Math Library (libmath)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
<Library Bug Fixes>
- If you tried to convert (int)0x80000000 to a floating or double type, 
an infinite loop was entered.  This problem has been fixed.

- If you tried to convert (floating or double)-0.0 to an int, 
0x80000000 was returned.  This problem has been fixed.


Extended Memory Card Library (libmcrd)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
<Header File Modification>
- For the following functions, the prototype statements in the 
document and the header file were inconsistent.  This problem has been 
fixed.

	MemCardInit(), MemCardOpen(), MemCardReadData(), 
	MemCardReadFile(), MemCardWriteData(), MemCardWriteFile(), 
	MemCardCreateFile(), MemCardDeleteFile(), MemCardSync(), 
	MemCardGetDirentry() 

<Library Bug Fixes>
- When MemCardGetDirentry() was executed against an memory card which
had no saved data, a value was not set to "files" (fourth parameter.)
This problem has been fixed.

- The required number of VSync for MemCardReadData(), 
MemCardWriteData(), MemCardReadFile() and MemCardWriteFile() had 
increased compared to version 4.1.  This problem has been fixed.


Controller Library (libpad)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
<Library Bug Fixes>
- When a controller was inserted in one controller port, and another 
was inserted into another controller port halfway, and then inserted 
all the way, an incorrect value was set to the receive buffer for the 
the first controller occasionally. This problem has been fixed.

- When an Analog Controller (DUAL SHOCK) was used, if PadStartCom() 
was executed within three seconds after PadStopCom(), the Analog 
Controller (DUAL SHOCK) became unable to be recognized.  This problem 
has been fixed.

- While a controller was connected via the Multi Tap, a hang-up 
occurred, or an incorrect value was set to the receive buffer 
occasionally.  This problem has been fixed.


Serial Input/Output Library (libsio)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
<Header File Modification>
- The prototype statement of _sio_control() in the document 
and the header file was inconsistent.  This problem has been fixed.


Extended Sound Library (libsnd)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
<Library Bug Fixes>
- When a negative value was passed to "fine" of SsPitchFromNote(), a 
correct value was not returned.  This problem has been fixed.

- Starting from version 4.0, the algorithm for converting "note" to 
"pitch" was different in libspu and libsnd.  They were changed to be 
the same.

- In SEQ data, when NRPN with CC99=16 (such as Reverb depth) was used 
in a track without a program change, this control became invalid.  
This problem has been fixed.

- When SsSeqSetCrescendo() or SsSeqSetDecrescendo() was used, the 
sequence volume value was not equal to the expected value after 
crescendo or decrescendo.  This problem has been fixed.

<Functionality Added>
- SsInit() was changed so that the reverb work area is cleared 
internally.  As a result, the process takes longer compared to 
previous versions.
(As long as SpuClearReverbWorkArea(SPU_REV_MODE_ECHO) function 
execution).


Basic Sound Library (libspu)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
<Library Bug Fixes>
- Starting from version 4.0, the algorithm for converting "note" to 
"pitch" was different in libspu and libsnd.  They were changed to be 
the same.

Multi-tap Library (libtap)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
<Header File Modification>
- The return value type for StartTAP(), InitTAP(), StopTAP() and 
SendTAP() was corrected (from long to void.)
