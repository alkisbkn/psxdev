The files supplied in \H25DRV are being retained on the CD for backwards compatibility.  
H25.DRV is a driver for use with the DTLH-2500 boards and is designed to be used with
DECICONS, a command line PlayStation communication utility.

Files for flashing the memory of the board for use with H25.DRV can be found in the
following directory:

	\psx\bin\DTLH2500\H25DRV - contains the flash memory program
				   and files for running the DTL-H2500
				   under the H25DRV.EXE driver. 

	H25drv.exe can be found in the \psx\bin directory.


The files for flashing the board for use with SN products such as WinDebug can be found in:
 
	\pssn\bin\DTLH2500\H25BIOS - contains the flash memory program
				   and files for running the DTL-H2500
				   under the SN Systems H25BIOS.COM driver
				   

Instructions on installing the boards have been moved
to \psx\bin\DTLH2500, in the file "install.doc".
