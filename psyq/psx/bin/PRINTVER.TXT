USAGE:

Name
     printver - extract version information from library

Format
     printver  file ...

Description
The printver command searches the library files provided and outputs all the
version information for the files.

When multiple input files are specified for the file argument, the information
for each library is output.

Command line options are as follows.

     -h
     -help
             Displays a brief help message.

Output format
The output from printver consists of: the library name; the date and time the
library was compiled; and the version number of the library file.

Examples
Extract version information from libc.lib (the date/time of compilation and
the version number shown in the example below are made up).

     c:> printver libc.lib
        libc     -- Apr 30, 00:00, 1997  [4.0]

Extract version information from libsnd.lib and libspu.lib.

     c:> printver libsnd.lib libspu.lib
        libsnd   -- Apr 30, 01:00, 1997  [4.0]
        libspu   -- Apr 30, 02:00, 1997  [4.0]

Notes
Regular expressions cannot be used for the file argument.

The extraction of version information is supported for version 3.6 libraries
and after (certain libraries are unsupported).

It is possible for erroneous version information to be obtained when searching 
library files, due to internal layout in the .lib file.
