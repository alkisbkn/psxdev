Known Bugs and Cautions
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
< Known Bugs >

- The following 2D environment mapping data of HMD environment mapping
  (beta version) can not be converted correctly HMD -> LAB -> HMD.
  This problem will be fixed on the next release.

	data\hmd\scei\envmap\star09
	data\hmd\scei\envmap\venus26


- "tuto5", "tuto6", "tuto7", "tuto8" and "tuto9" in the following directories
  provide messages "Use DTL-S2320" and/or "Use DTL-S2310" on the screen.
  The correct name of CD-ROM that is required to run those samples, is
  DTL-S2340.  Those messages will be removed on the next release.

	sample\cd\tuto\
	sample\ds\tuto\


- When the following sample programs are executed as a child process of the 
  "pcmenu" program in sample\module\menu, and then the child process
  returns to the "pcmenu" program, a hang-up occurs occasionally.
  This problem will be fixed in the next release.

	sample\sound\stream\tuto1
	sample\sound\stream\tuto2


Directory Structure Changes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
< Addition for \psx\data >
- Formally, sample data were placed on each sample directory.
  Those sample data are gathered under \psx\data from this release.
  Herewith this changes data paths in each sample's "makefile.mak" are
  modified.  In addition, the following directories are removed.

	\psx\sample\graphics\data
	\psx\sample\graphics\hmd\data
	\psx\sample\graphics\texaddr\wave\data
	\psx\sample\graphics\tmdview\data
	\psx\sample\graphics\tod\janken\tmd
	\psx\sample\graphics\tod\janken\tod
	\psx\sample\sound\data

< Addition for \xdata >
- "da", "xa" and "mov.str" files are moved from \xa, \da and \data directories
  to \xdata.  Herewith, sample programs that accesses to those data on CD-ROM
  are modified.  In addition, the following directories are removed.

	\da
	\xa
	\data


< Remove for \execmenu and \overmenu >
- \execmenu and \overmenu directories are removed from this release CD-ROM.

< Remove for \psx\utility >
- \psx\utility is removed from this release.  Samples formally under the
  \psx\utility directory are changed as the following.

	- \psx\utility\cdexec
		This directory is removed from this release.
		Please refer to the similar sample in sample\module\cdexec.
	- \psx\utility\menu\
		This directory is moved to \psx\sample\module.
	- \psx\utility\screen\
		This directory is moved to \psx\sample\graphics.

< Remove for \psx\kanji >
- ROM font sample program formally on \psx\kanji is moved to \psx\sample\kanji.

< Remove for "makefile.6x" >
- "makefile.6x" for DTL-H5000 in each sample are removed from this release.
  Please write your own make file with refer to "makefile.mak", to compile on
  DTL-H5000 environment.


New Additions
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
< HMD data addition >
- data\hmd\scei\anim\rots
	New sample data that shows 6 variations of rotation order is added.

- data\hmd\scei\anim\domesc
	New sample data to show almost of HMD colored polygons/shared-polygons
	is added.

- data\hmd\scei\equip\pp
	HMD equipment primitive (camera) sample data are added.
	This directory contains 3 kind of data corresponds with 3 camera
	types.

- data\hmd\scei\equip\snowman
	HMD equipment primitive (camera and light) sample data is added.

< HMD sample addition >
- sample\graphics\hmd\basic
	normview to display polygon normal vectors is added.

- sample\graphics\hmd\common
	New scanning routine for HMD equipment primitive (camera and light)
	and sample primitive driver to display polygon normal vectors are
	added.


Existing Samples Improved, Changed and Corrected
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
< module >
- sample\module\execmenu
- sample\module\overmenu
	Descriptions in readme_j.txt and readme_e.txt regarding data on CD-ROM
	are removed because of removing \execmenu and \overmenu.
	Please create CD-R disk with referring to readme_j.txt or readme_e.txt
	to run sample\module\execmenu and/or sample\module\overmenu.

< HMD >
- data\hmd\scei\envmap\star09
	Formally, star09.hmd was not able to dis-assemble with xhmd command.
	Because PolyPrimHdr_0000 was defined as a header for environment
	mapping however this header related to ordinary polygon primitive.
	xhmd will provide an error when such invalid data found in input file.
	Now, star09 has fixed, star09.hmd can be dis-assembled.

- data\hmd\scei\envmap\venus11
- data\hmd\scei\envmap\venus26
- data\hmd\scei\envmap\yesno5
	M(0) is changed to NULL in environment mapping primitive headers.
	With M(0), it causes unexpected mapping with GsMapUnit() function	calling.

- data\hmd\scei\envmap\texture
	"readme_e.txt" was released as empty file, thus this problem is fixed.

- sample\graphics\hmd\common
	Scanning routine is changed to correspond for new primitive drivers.

Brief Description of Directory: \PSX\SAMPLE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This directory contains all samples produced by SCE (Japan),
SCEE (Europe) and SCEA (America).  The most basic samples
are in the "tuto" subdirectories (short for tutorial).
They are not accompanied by an actual tutorial, but they 
can be understood using the concepts discussed in the 
"Library Overview" manual of the Technical Reference CDROM.

	\CD       -Contains samples that demonstrate streaming
		   music and video data from the CD. 
	\CMPLR    -Contains a scratch pad sample.
	\CONTRIB* -Contains information about contributing 
		   your own samples
	\CONTROL* -Contains samples that demonstrate
		   code for controllers, such as the mouse, 
		   multitap, and the light gun.
	\DS	  -Contains samples that mirror those
		   in \PSX\SAMPLE\CD\TUTO, but use
		   LIBDS functions instead. 
	\ETC	  -This directory has been eliminated. The contents
		   have been placed in the directories marked
		   by a "*" in this list.  
	\GRAPHICS -Contains dozens of samples for creating
		   2D and 3D graphics, including sprites,
		   textured polygons, and hierarchical animation.
		   Demonstrates the low level LIBGTE and LIBPU 
		   functions as well as the higher level
		   LIBGS.
	\KANJI	  -Demonstrates how to use the Kanji routines.
	\MATH	  -Demonstrates higher level math functions.
	\MEMCARD* -Demonstrates how to use the memory card.
	\MODULE	  -Demonstrates how programs can launch other
		   programs on the PlayStation.
	\OLD	  -Legacy code provided only for reference.
	\PRESS	  -Demonstrates MDEG image comPRESSion routines.
	\SERIAL*  -Contains samples that use the combat cable and 
		   the DTL-H3050.
	\SCEA	  -Samples contributed by developers and 
		   tech supporters in North America.
	\SCEE	  -Samples contributed by developers and
		   tech supporters in Europe.
	\SOUND	  -Sound samples demonstrating LIBSND and LIBSPU. 		  
	\THREAD*  -Sample demonstrating how to use threads.

("*" indicates that the contents of these  directories 
  were formerly in the directory "\ETC", which has now
  been eliminated to avoid confusion with LIBETC.) 

Almost all samples (except those in \SCEE and \SCEE) have
been precompiled for use with the  utility
"cdmenu.bat" in the directory \psx\utility\menu.  This
utility allows you to browse through all of the samples
with the Programmer Tools CD inserted into the DTL-H2010 or
the DTL-H2510 (your development board's CD-ROM drives).


The contents of this CD are comprehensively discussed in 
the HTML document "readme.htm" in the root directory of the Programmer
Tools CD. You should point your HTML 3.0  compatible Web browser at 
the document on the CD.  Because the hyperlinks refer to documents on the CD,
make sure the CD is in the drive.

You can download the latest Web browsers at www.netscape.com (for the 
Netscape Navigator) and at www.microsoft.com (for the Internet Explorer).

If you do not have access to the Web, pdf versions of these documents are
available in the directory "doc" on the CD.  Read the "readme.txt" there
for more information on its contents. 

Adobe Acrobat, which can read pdf files, is available on the 
Technical Reference CD.
