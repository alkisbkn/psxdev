DEPLOYING ON NO$PSX
-------------------

The No$Psx emulator is included in this repository. The Debug/Release EMU configurations will use that to run the project.
It's already in the PATH so no extra effort should exist to run it; pressing Run in the VS project for the approriate EMU 
configuratio should work fine.


DEPLOYING ON REAL PSX HARDWARE
------------------------------

To deploy on a real PSX you will need the following:

1) A Windows 7 (x86 or x64) as a development system
2) An LPT1 port on your motherboard; this can be a PciE expansion card or a LPT1 slot on the motherboard itself. USB to LPT1 does not work.
3) A PSX with a Parallel port (only the early models have this)
4) An XplorerFX cartridge. No other cheat cartridge will work. This also needs to be flashed to Caetla 0.34.
5) Catflap program & inpout32 driver, used to communicate with the PSX through the parallel port (This is already included in the psyq\bin directory).

Instructions on how to flash XplorerFX: https://github.com/simias/rustation/wiki/Xplorer-FX-setup
You can also find the same instructions in the "Xplorer FX setup.pdf". All credit for this goes to Adam Becker.

Once all this is setup, you can run the project by pressing Run in the VS project, for the appropriate PSX configuration.
