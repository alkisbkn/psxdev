BUILD CONFIGURATIONS
--------------------

Each sub-project has its own VS2017 project. Each project has 4 configurations:

1) Debug/Release EMU
2) Debug/Release PSX

EMU Configuration:
------------------
This configuration uses the No$Psx emulator to run the generated cd image.


PSX Configuration:
------------------
This configuration uses catflap to send the final executable to the PSX, as shown in the XplorerFX setup example.
