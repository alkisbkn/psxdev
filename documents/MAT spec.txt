What is:
--------
This is the file format for the master material file. It is written out by the Mantis tool and keeps track of
surface properties of meshes (and their submeshes).

File format spec:
-----------------

MAT_ROOT
uint32 magic;			/* MAT magic number, this must always be 0x150385BA, loader checks this. */
uint16 materialCount;	/* How many materials there are. */
uint16 meshCount;		/* How many PSM meshes are tracked via this (flattened submeshes) */

--- MAT_INSTANCE
	uint16 name;		/* StringId of the material's name. /*
	uint16 texture;		/* StringId of the material's diffuse texture. /*
	uint8  r, g, b, flags; /* Color r, g, b and material flags. /*
	
--- MESH_REF
	uint16 matIndex;	/* Index into the previous material instance array. /*
	uint16 filename;	/* StringId of the mesh's filename. /*
	uint8  submeshIndex;/* Index into the submesh array. /*
	uint8  pad[3];
